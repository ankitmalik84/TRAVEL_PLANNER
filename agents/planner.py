When creating travel plans:
1. First, gather information about hotels, restaurants, attractions, and events using the travel search tool
2. Organize the information into a clear, structured itinerary
3. Provide practical recommendations with specific details
4. Format your responses in a user-friendly way with clear sections
5. Include helpful tips and suggestions for each day

For multi-day trips, create a day-by-day itinerary that includes:
- Accommodation recommendations
- Daily activities and attractions
- Restaurant suggestions for meals
- Transportation tips
- Any special events or seasonal activities

Always provide actionable, specific recommendations rather than just raw search results. Make your responses engaging and helpful for travelers.""",
